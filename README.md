## This repository shows how to use FDTD with absorbing boundary conditions for modeling arbitrary planar microwave circuits.

The EM_solver_FDTD.py provides a fast and accurate simulation of planar microwave circuits using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method.

The file FDTD_code.ipynb demonstrates how to use the EM_solver_FDTD for modeling general planar microwave circuits. This demo includes details on input parameters, output results, and S-parameter extraction.

The EM_solver_FDTD can be easily adapted for arbitrary FDTD simulations.
